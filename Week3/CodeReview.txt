Code Review

Stage 1. Naming conventions

- rename Clasa1 to something more useful
- rename Calculeaza - use small caps
- rename the function arguments
- rename 'rezultat'
- rename 'valoare'
- format your code
- remove the hard-coded values aka "magix numbers"
- validate your input values
- replace if-then-else checks for the productType with switch

Stage 2. KISS, Single Responsibility, -> reduce functions complexion
- remove the switch by using a generic approach for each product type
- out-source the validations
- out-source the way the fidelity discount is computed

Stage 3. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- remove the dependency regarding the validation of input values
- remove the dependency on the static values - they are given by the Marketing Team
- remove the dependency on the way the fidelity discount is computed - Marketing Team will decide
